            So no one told you life was gonna be this way<br>
            Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A.<br>
            It's like you're always stuck in second gear<br>
            When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, but<br>
            <br>
            I'll be there for you<br>
            (When the rain starts to pour)<br>
            I'll be there for you<br>
            (Like I've been there before)<br>
            I'll be there for you<br>
            ('Cause you're there for me too)<br>
            <br>
            You're still in bed at ten and work began at eight<br>
            You've burned your breakfast, so far things are going great<br>
            Your mother warned you there'd be days like these<br>
            But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees that<br>
            <br>
            I'll be there for you<br>
            (When the rain starts to pour)<br>

            I'll be there for you<br>
            ('Cause you're there for me too)<br>
            <br>
            No one could ever know me<br>
            No one could ever see me<br>
            Seems you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me<br>
            Someone to face the day with, make it through all the rest with<br>
            Someone I'll always laugh with<br>
            Even at my worst, I'm best with you, yeah!<br>
            <br>
